# Dictionary_DOS
My C programming language class assignment, compiled and run on DOS with Watcom C compiler with a transplanted BGI graphic library.

This is my first class assignment on github, and the assignment is my first project that can be called a "program".

#Compile
You should compile it on a DOS virtual machine with WATCOM C compiler.

My teacher successfully transplanted the BGI graphic lib to the WATCOM C Conpiler. You may find it on the Repo.

In DOS, change to the project dir, and type "cc", all the source code will be compiled.

I don't know how to write a makefile.:\

#Run
type "main" in DOS window to run it.

Just follow the insruction. type --help in the program for more information.

#Note
The annotaion in the source code is witten in Chinese, my apology if you cannot understand it.

Source code is encoded in GB2313 character set. That means you may open it in GB2312 Encoding.
